I am an MD/PhD candidate at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. My work focuses on the building machine learning methods for healthcare. Specifically I am intested developing tools that help explain machine learning predictions to physicans and explanding the diagnostic utility of the ECG using machine learning. I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Rajesh Ranganath and Dr. Yindalon Aphinyanaphongs.

Before graduate school, I earned a BS from the University of California, San Deigo in Bioengineering. As an undergraduate student, I worked on projects investigating biomaterials for biomimetic systems and analysing sequencing data.

In general, I try to have an active life outside of research. I enjoy doing anything that puts me in nature: hiking, biking, rock climbing, surfing, swimming.
